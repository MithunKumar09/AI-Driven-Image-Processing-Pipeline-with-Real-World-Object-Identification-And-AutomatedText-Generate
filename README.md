# AiInternTask

## Overview

`AiInternTask` is a Streamlit-based application designed to showcase the use of AI and machine learning technologies through an interactive web application. This project integrates various machine learning models, provides dynamic data visualizations, and includes features for managing media uploads.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: A responsive and user-friendly interface built using Streamlit.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and plots to visualize data in real-time.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Integration with machine learning models for data predictions and insights.
- **Media Upload**: Functionality to upload and manage media files, including images and videos.

## Installation

To set up and run `AiInternTask` on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher. Check your Python version with:

## bash
python --version
Clone the Repository
Clone the repository from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/mithun-kumar/wasserstoff/AiInternTask.git
cd AiInternTask
Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment:

## bash
python -m venv newenv2
On Windows:

## bash

newenv2\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

## bash

source newenv2/bin/activate
Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:

## bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a .env File
Create a .env file in the root directory to store sensitive configuration details. Ensure it includes necessary environment variables such as API keys or database credentials. The .env file should look something like this:

## dotenv

# Example environment variables
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
Run the Application
Start the Streamlit application with:

## bash
streamlit run app.py

### Project Structure
