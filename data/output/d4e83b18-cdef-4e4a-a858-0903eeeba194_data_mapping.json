And that's even ignoring all the other stuff that's already there and getting things into a better place.\n\nBut that's what's so exciting to me and this project is about getting the apple even further.\n\nI think it has the potential to create an entirely new, awesome world with all these great features!\n\nAll I can think about, when."

However, it is also being used by Apple Computer\u2019s iPhone and iPad. Apple used the technology from Microsoft to launch the iPhone. Therefore, Apple is using the technology from Microsoft and they are trying to license it with Microsoft.\n\nThe question: does Apple have to license Windows to the iPhone and iPad? The answer is yes. And it also covers every version."
