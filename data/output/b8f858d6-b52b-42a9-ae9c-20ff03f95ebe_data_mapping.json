When I bought a Mac, I loved that I could\njust plug the keyboard into one of the USB ports and plug it in to my PC, and\nswitch it on. And I also love how the keyboard has a dedicated function key for\npushing a menu, and I never had to use the keyboard function keys to get to\nplaces."

Kahle, Associate Professor of Mathematics at Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Design, writes about the ways in which Apple\u2019s new MacBook computer and iMac desktop are redefining the way we think about computers, even if only in their own, \u201cnew\u201d sense. The essay concludes with a set of predictions."
