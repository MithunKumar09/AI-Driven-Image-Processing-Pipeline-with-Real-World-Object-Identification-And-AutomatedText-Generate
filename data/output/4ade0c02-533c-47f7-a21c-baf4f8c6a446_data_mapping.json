Apple is available in supermarkets all over the UK. However, some of those supermarkets are in London, so they don't have apples in their shops. The supermarket I mentioned just had apples, but the shops are in another city. To make the story somewhat easier to read, I am referring to the US supermarkets."

I am talking about the entire tree of apples, and about the apple itself. To be truly precise, I want to consider the tree as a whole, and not just a single apple. It has to be that apple, which is defined by its fruit.\n\nApple trees produce more apples than are eaten."
